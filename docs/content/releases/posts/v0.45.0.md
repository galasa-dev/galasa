# 0.45.0 - Release Highlights

## Changes affecting tests running locally or on the Galasa Service

- When a local test run shares a Dynamic Status Store (DSS) with a Galasa service and the run exits while in the 'queued' state, the test run will be interrupted and the DSS record for that run will be cleaned up after a period of time has passed. See [#2395](https://github.com/galasa-dev/projectmanagement/issues/2395).
  - By default, local 'queued' runs are set to time out after 15 minutes but this can be changed by setting the new `framework.resource.management.local.queued.timeout` CPS property to the desired amount of time in seconds.
