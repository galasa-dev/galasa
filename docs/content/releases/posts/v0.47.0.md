# 0.47.0 - Release Highlights

## Changes affecting tests running locally or on the Galasa Service

- The artifacts.properties file containing information about a local test run's artifacts will no longer be created and stored in the local RAS. Instead, an artifacts.json file will be created to provide more flexibility in the amount of metadata that can be included for each artifact.
- artifacts.json was already provided for runs in a Galasa service so the artifacts.properties file will no longer be provided.
