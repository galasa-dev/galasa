# 0.47.0 - Release Highlights

## Changes affecting the Galasa Service

- Added new REST API endpoints `POST /streams` and `PUT /streams/<streamName>` to allow users to create and update test streams. See the [REST API reference](../../docs/reference/rest-api/index.html) for more details. See also [#2447](https://github.com/galasa-dev/projectmanagement/issues/2447).

- Added a new `galasactl streams set` command that can be used to create or update test streams within a Galasa service. [See the command reference](../../docs/reference/cli-syntax/galasactl_streams_set.md).
