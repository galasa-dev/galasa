# 0.46.0 - Release Highlights

## Changes affecting tests running locally or on the Galasa Service

- The SSH client library that Galasa uses has been updated to support stronger key algorithms, including `rsa-sha2-256` and `rsa-sha2-512`. See [#2461](https://github.com/galasa-dev/projectmanagement/issues/2461).
  - **Galasa managers that use the IP network manager, like the zOS TSO Command SSH and zOS UNIX Command SSH managers, no longer support the RSA/SHA1 signature algorithm when connecting to a server via SSH. If you are using RSA/SHA1, you should upgrade your servers to use a stronger algorithm.**
