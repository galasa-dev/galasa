name: Check Required Secrets Configured

# This is a reusable workflow which checks if the required secrets for workflows have been configured.
# The calling workflow should set the inputs below based on which secrets it needs.
# Then this workflow will check if that secret is set in the workflow's repository.
# It then reports all missing secrets in the last step if it finds any.
